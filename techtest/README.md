# NDTec Frontend Test 2019

Welcome to NDTec Frontend Test 2019

## Prerequisites

Node needs to be installed on your development environment 

## Instructions

You have been provided with a simple node server that will return data in a schema similar to what the NDTec apps use

The payload itself contains 7 products. The documentation provided includes a screenshot of the data as it's captured in the backend, use this screenshot to verify that the product results displayed on the listing page matches how it has been captured.

Upon completion of the tasks below, you should commit and push your finished work back to origin.

You can complete this test using native javascript/html, vue or react.

## Tasks
### 1. Create a listing page that displays the 7 products

Each product needs to display the following
- Code
- Description
- Image
- Price (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Send To Basket Button

You will have to extract the correct property values for each product using the permutations data structure - you can reference App data schema.docx located in the project root for an explanation of how the data works

### 2. Create a basket page that will contain any products sent to basket
Each product should display the same fields as per the listing page, but the Send To Basket button should now be a Remove from basket button
